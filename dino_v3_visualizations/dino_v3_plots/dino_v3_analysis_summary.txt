SILHOUETTE SCORE EXPLANATION:

    🎯 SILHOUETTE SCORE EXPLAINED:
    
    The Silhouette Score measures how well-separated clusters are in your embedding space.
    It's crucial for validating whether your learned representations are meaningful.
    
    📈 How it works:
    For each sample point:
    1. Calculate 'a': Average distance to other points in the SAME cluster (phase)
    2. Calculate 'b': Average distance to points in the NEAREST other cluster
    3. Silhouette score for point i: s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))
    
    📊 Score interpretation:
    • +1.0: Perfect clustering (point is much closer to own cluster than others)
    • +0.5: Good clustering (point is reasonably well-placed)
    •  0.0: Point is on the border between two clusters
    • -0.5: Poor clustering (point might be in wrong cluster)
    • -1.0: Very poor clustering (point is closer to other clusters)
    
    🔍 What it tells us about your embeddings:
    • HIGH silhouette (>0.5): Your encoder learned meaningful phase representations
    • MEDIUM silhouette (0.2-0.5): Decent separation, some overlap between phases
    • LOW silhouette (<0.2): Phases are poorly separated - encoder may need improvement
    
    ⚠️ Important considerations:
    • Works best with well-defined, separated clusters
    • Can be misleading with complex cluster shapes
    • Compare across different dimensionality reduction methods
    • Higher dimensions may show different patterns than 2D/3D visualizations
